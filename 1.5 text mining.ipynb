(disambiguation).', \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland First edition cover (1865)AuthorLewis CarrollIllustratorJohn TennielLanguageEnglishGenrePortal fantasyLiterary nonsensePublisherMacmillanPublication dateNovember 1865Publication placeUnited KingdomFollowed\\xa0byThrough the Looking-Glass\\xa0TextAlice's Adventures in Wonderland at Wikisource Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (also known as  Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children's novel by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics don at the University of Oxford.\", 'It details the story of a girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures.', 'It is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre.', 'The artist Sir John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book.', 'It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known works of Victorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.', '[1][2] It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children\\'s literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\".', '[3] The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.', '[4] The titular character Alice shares her name with Alice Liddell, a girl Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.', '[5][6] The book has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages.', 'Its legacy includes adaptations to screen, radio, visual art, ballet, opera, and musical theatre, as well as theme parks, board games and video games.', '[7] Carroll published a sequel in 1871 entitled Through the Looking-Glass and a shortened version for young children, The Nursery \"Alice\", in 1890.', 'Background[edit] \"All in the golden afternoon...\"[edit] Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland was conceived on 4 July 1862, when Lewis Carroll and Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river Isis with the three young daughters of Carroll\\'s friend Henry Liddell:[8][9] Lorina Charlotte (aged 13; \"Prima\" in the book\\'s prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance (aged 10; \"Secunda\" in the verse); and Edith Mary (aged 8; \"Tertia\" in the verse).', '[10]  Lewis Carroll in 1863 The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford, and ended 5 miles (8\\xa0km) upstream at Godstow, Oxfordshire.', 'During the trip, Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as \"Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground\", which his journal says he \"undertook to write out for Alice\".', '[11] Alice Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she wanted to preserve.', '[12] She finally received the manuscript more than two years later.', '[13] 4 July was known as the \"golden afternoon\", prefaced in the novel as a poem.', '[14] In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was \"cool and rather wet\", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim.', '[15] Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the \"golden afternoon\" or whether the story was developed over a longer period.', '[14] Carroll had known the Liddell children since around March 1856, when he befriended Harry Liddell.', '[16] He had met Lorina by early March as well.', '[17] In June 1856, he took the children out on the river.', '[18] Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll favoured Alice Pleasance Liddell in particular because her name was ripe for allusion.', '[19] \"Pleasance\" means pleasure and the name \"Alice\" appeared in contemporary works, including the poem \"Alice Gray\" by William Mee, of which Carroll wrote a parody; Alice is a character in \"Dream-Children: A Reverie\", a prose piece by Charles Lamb.', '[19] Carroll, an amateur photographer by the late 1850s,[20] produced many photographic portraits of the Liddell children – and especially of Alice, of which 20 survive.', \"[21]  Manuscript: Alice's Adventures Under Ground[edit] Page from the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground, 1864.\", 'Handwritten and illustrated by Carroll, it is held in the British Library.', 'Carroll began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version is lost.', 'The girls and Carroll took another boat trip a month later, when he elaborated the plot of the story to Alice, and in November, he began working on the manuscript in earnest.', '[22] To add the finishing touches, he researched natural history in connection with the animals presented in the book and then had the book examined by other children—particularly those of George MacDonald.', 'Though Carroll did add his own illustrations to the original copy, on publication he was advised to find a professional illustrator so that the pictures were more appealing to his audience.', 'He subsequently approached John Tenniel to reinterpret his visions through his own artistic eye, telling him that the story had been well-liked by the children.', '[22] Carroll began planning a print edition of the Alice story in 1863.', \"[23] He wrote on 9 May 1863 that MacDonald's family had suggested he publish Alice.\", '[13] A diary entry for 2 July says that he received a specimen page of the print edition around that date.', '[23] On 26 November 1864, Carroll gave Alice the manuscript of Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground, with illustrations by Carroll, dedicating it as \"A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer\\'s Day\".', \"[24][25] The published version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is about twice the length of Alice's Adventures Under Ground and includes episodes, such as the Mad Hatter's Tea-Party (or Mad Tea Party), that do not appear in the manuscript.\", '[26][23] The only known manuscript copy of Under Ground is held in the British Library.', '[23] Macmillan published a facsimile of the manuscript in 1886.', '[23]  Plot[edit] The White Rabbit Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots a White Rabbit with a pocket watch and waistcoat lamenting that he is late.', 'Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing.', 'Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden.', 'While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled \"Drink me\".', \"Alice drinks some of the bottle's contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door.\", 'However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it.', 'Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled \"Eat me\", which causes her to grow to a tremendous size.', 'Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves.', 'Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears.', 'Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a \"Caucus Race\" to dry themselves.', 'Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.', 'The Cheshire Cat The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan.', 'Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them.', 'Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house.', 'Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes.', 'Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest.', 'She meets a Caterpillar seated on a mushroom and smoking a hookah.', \"During the Caterpillar's questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem.\", 'Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller.', \"During a period of trial and error, Alice's neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent.\", 'After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of a Duchess, who owns a perpetually grinning Cheshire Cat.', \"The Duchess's baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods.\", 'The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward the Hatter and March Hare before disappearing, leaving his grin behind.', 'Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepy Dormouse in the midst of a tea party.', 'The Hatter explains that it is always 6\\xa0p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to \"kill it\".', 'A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\"', 'is brought up.', 'Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.', 'Alice trying to play croquet with a Flamingo Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey.', 'She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be the croquet court of the Queen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards.', 'Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops.', 'The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings.', 'When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible.', 'Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.', 'When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.', 'Alice then meets a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, who dance to the Lobster Quadrille while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) a poem.', 'The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\", during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which the Knave of Hearts stands accused of stealing the Queen\\'s tarts.', 'The trial is conducted by the King of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met.', 'Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings.', \"The Queen eventually commands Alice's beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen's guard is only a pack of cards.\", 'Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her.', \"Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice's face.\", 'Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.', \"Characters[edit] Further information: List of minor characters in the Alice series The main characters in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are the following:   Alice The White Rabbit The Mouse The Dodo The Lory The Eaglet The Duck Pat Bill the Lizard Puppy The Caterpillar The Duchess The Cheshire Cat The Hatter The March Hare The Dormouse The Queen of Hearts The King of Hearts The Knave of Hearts The Gryphon The Mock Turtle Character allusions[edit] Mad Tea Party.\", 'Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer from Oxford, has been suggested as a model for The Hatter.', 'In The Annotated Alice, Martin Gardner provides background information for the characters.', 'The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll\\'s tale show up in chapter 3 (\"A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\").', 'Alice Liddell is there, while Carroll is caricatured as the Dodo (Lewis Carroll was a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson; because he stuttered when he spoke, he sometimes pronounced his last name as \"Dodo-Dodgson\").', \"The Duck refers to Robinson Duckworth, and the Lory and Eaglet to Alice Liddell's sisters Lorina and Edith.\", '[27] Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.', '[28] One of Tenniel\\'s illustrations in Through the Looking-Glass— the 1871 sequel to Alice— depicts the character referred to as the \"Man in White Paper\" (whom Alice meets on a train) as a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat.', '[29] The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn (also in Looking-Glass) look like Tenniel\\'s Punch illustrations of William Ewart Gladstone and Disraeli, although Gardner says there is \"no proof\" that they were intended to represent these politicians.', \"[30] Gardner has suggested that the Hatter is a reference to Theophilus Carter, an Oxford furniture dealer, and that Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll's.\", '[31] The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie.', 'These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C.', '(Lorina Charlotte); Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda); and Lacie is an anagram of Alice.', '[32] The Mock Turtle speaks of a drawling-master, \"an old conger eel\", who came once a week to teach \"Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils\".', 'This is a reference to the art critic John Ruskin, who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children to draw, sketch, and paint in oils.', '[33][34] The Mock Turtle sings \"Turtle Soup\", which is a parody of a song called \"Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star\", which the Liddells sang for Carroll.', '[35][36]  Poems and songs[edit] Carroll wrote multiple poems and songs for Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, including:  \"All in the golden afternoon...\"—the prefatory verse to the book, an original poem by Carroll that recalls the rowing expedition on which he first told the story of Alice\\'s adventures underground \"How Doth the Little Crocodile\"—a parody of Isaac Watts\\'s nursery rhyme, \"Against Idleness and Mischief\"[37] \"The Mouse\\'s Tale\"—an example of concrete poetry \"You Are Old, Father William\"—a parody of Robert Southey\\'s \"The Old Man\\'s Comforts and How He Gained Them\"[38] The Duchess\\'s lullaby, \"Speak roughly to your little boy...\"—a parody of David Bates\\' \"Speak Gently\" \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat\"—a parody of Jane Taylor\\'s \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"[39] \"The Lobster Quadrille\"—a parody of Mary Botham Howitt\\'s \"The Spider and the

Cohen reads Alice as a roman à clef populated with real figures from Carroll\\'s life.', \"Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice's own birthday party.\", \"[5] The critic Jan Susina rejects Cohen's account, arguing that Alice the character bears a tenuous relationship with Alice Liddell.\", \"[6] Beyond its refashioning of Carroll's everyday life, Cohen argues, Alice critiques Victorian ideals of childhood.\", 'It is an account of \"the child\\'s plight in Victorian upper-class society\", in which Alice\\'s mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll\\'s own mistreatment by older people as a child.', '[43] In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that the Queen of Hearts hates.', 'According to Wilfrid Scott-Giles, the rose motif in Alice alludes to the English Wars of the Roses: red roses symbolised the House of Lancaster, and white roses the rival House of York.', '[44]  Language[edit] Alice is full of linguistic play, puns, and parodies.', '[45] According to Gillian Beer, Carroll\\'s play with language evokes the feeling of words for new readers: they \"still have insecure edges and a nimbus of nonsense blurs the sharp focus of terms\".', \"[46] The literary scholar Jessica Straley, in a work about the role of evolutionary theory in Victorian children's literature, argues that Carroll's focus on language prioritises humanism over scientism by emphasising language's role in human self-conception.\", '[47] Pat\\'s \"Digging for apples\" is a cross-language pun, as pomme de terre (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and pomme means apple.', '[48] In the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun declensions \"in her brother\\'s Latin Grammar, \\'A mouse – of a mouse – to a mouse – a mouse – O mouse!\\'\"', \"These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: mus (nominative), muris (genitive), muri (dative), murem (accusative), (O) mus (vocative).\", \"The sixth case, mure (ablative) is absent from Alice's recitation.\", \"Nilson suggests that Alice's missing ablative is a pun on her father Henry Liddell's work on the standard A Greek-English Lexicon, since ancient Greek does not have an ablative case.\", 'Further, mousa (μούσα, meaning muse) was a standard model noun in Greek textbooks of the time in paradigms of the first declension, short-alpha noun.', '[49]  Mathematics[edit] Mathematics and logic are central to Alice.', '[50] As Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and Through the Looking-Glass.', '[51][52] Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserts in the New Scientist magazine that Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland in its final form as a satire on mid-19th century mathematics.', '[53]  Eating and devouring[edit] Carina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice\\'s frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her \\'Curious Appetites\\'.', '[54] Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.', 'After the riddle \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?', '\", the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, \"I see what I eat…I eat what I see\" and so the riddle\\'s solution, put forward by Boe Birns, could be that \"A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten\"; this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life itself, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater—a horrific image of mortality.', '[55] Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which \"motivates much of her [Alice\\'s] behaviour\", for the story is essentially about things \"entering and leaving her mouth.', '\"[56] The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest, for Alice\\'s relation to them shifts constantly because, as Lovell-Smith states, Alice\\'s changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the \\'eat or be eaten\\' attitude that permeates Wonderland.', '[57]  Nonsense[edit] Alice is an example of the literary nonsense genre.', \"[58] According to Humphrey Carpenter, Alice's brand of nonsense embraces the nihilistic and existential.\", \"Characters in nonsensical episodes such as the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, in which it is always the same time, go on posing paradoxes that are never resolved.\", '[59]  Rules and games[edit] Wonderland is a rule-bound world, but its rules are not those of our world.', 'The literary scholar Daniel Bivona writes that Alice is characterised by \"gamelike social structures.', '\"[60] She trusts in instructions from the beginning, drinking from the bottle labelled \"drink me\" after recalling, during her descent, that children who do not follow the rules often meet terrible fates.', \"[61] Unlike the creatures of Wonderland, who approach their world's wonders uncritically, Alice continues to look for rules as the story progresses.\", 'Gillian Beer suggests that Alice looks for rules to soothe her anxiety, while Carroll may have hunted for rules because he struggled with the implications of the non-Euclidean geometry then in development.', \"[62]  Illustrations[edit] Main article: Illustrators of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Alice by John Tenniel, one of his 42 illustrations for the 1865 published version of the book.\", 'The manuscript was illustrated by Carroll, who added 37 illustrations—printed in a facsimile edition in 1887.', '[24] John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the published version of the book.', \"[63] The first print run was destroyed (or sold in the US)[64] at Carroll's request because Tenniel was dissatisfied with the printing quality.\", 'There are only 22 known first edition copies in existence.', '[63] The book was reprinted and published in 1866.', \"[24] Tenniel's detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the characters.\", \"[65] Tenniel's illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell,[6] who had dark hair and a short fringe.\", \"Alice has provided a challenge for other illustrators, including those of 1907 by Charles Pears and the full series of colour plates and line-drawings by Harry Rountree published in the (inter-War) Children's Press (Glasgow) edition.\", 'Other significant illustrators include: Arthur Rackham (1907), Willy Pogany (1929), Mervyn Peake (1946), Ralph Steadman (1967), Salvador Dalí (1969), Graham Overden (1969), Max Ernst (1970), Peter Blake (1970), Tove Jansson (1977), Anthony Browne (1988), Helen Oxenbury (1999),[66] and Lisbeth Zwerger (1999).', 'Publication history[edit] Carroll first met Alexander Macmillan, a high-powered London publisher, on 19 October 1863.', \"[13] His firm, Macmillan Publishers, agreed to publish Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by sometime in 1864.\", '[67] Carroll financed the initial print run, possibly because it gave him more editorial authority than other financing methods.', '[67] He managed publication details such as typesetting and engaged illustrators and translators.', \"[68] Macmillan had published The Water-Babies, also a children's fantasy, in 1863, and suggested its design as a basis for Alice's.\", '[69] Carroll saw a specimen copy in May 1865.', '[70] 2,000 copies were printed by July, but Tenniel objected to their quality, and Carroll instructed Macmillan to halt publication so they could be reprinted.', '[24][71] In August, he engaged Richard Clay as an alternative printer for a new run of 2,000.', '[72] The reprint cost £600, paid entirely by Carroll.', \"[73] He received the first copy of Clay's edition on 9 November 1865.\", \"[73]  Opening pages of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Macmillan Publishers, London Macmillan finally published the new edition, printed by Richard Clay, in November 1865.\", '[2][74] Carroll requested a red binding, deeming it appealing to young readers.', '[75][76]  A new edition, released in December 1865 for the Christmas market but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed.', \"[77][78] The text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with Carroll's permission to the New York publishing house of D.
